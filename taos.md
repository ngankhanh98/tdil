- _"By their nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we can’t always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch
statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of course, with
polymorphism."_ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**

- _The ideal number of arguments for a function is
zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed
closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic)
should be avoided where possible. More than three
(polyadic) requires very special justification—and
then shouldn’t be used anyway._ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**

- _When a function seems to need more than two or three arguments, it is likely that some of
those arguments ought to be wrapped into a class of their own._ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**

- _Duplication may be the root of all evil in software_ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**
- _Master programmers think of systems as stories to be told rather than programs to
be written. They use the facilities of their chosen programming language to construct a
much richer and more expressive language that can be used to tell that story._ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**

- _The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in
code. Note that I used the word failure. I meant it. Comments are always failures. We must
have them because we cannot always figure out how to express ourselves without them,
but their use is not a cause for celebration. <br>
So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it
through and see whether there isn’t some way to turn the tables and express yourself in
code. Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back. Every
time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of
expression._ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**
