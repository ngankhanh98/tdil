- _"By their nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we canâ€™t always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch
statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of course, with
polymorphism."_ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**
