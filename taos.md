- _"By their nature, switch statements always do N things. Unfortunately we can’t always avoid switch statements, but we can make sure that each switch
statement is buried in a low-level class and is never repeated. We do this, of course, with
polymorphism."_ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**

- _The ideal number of arguments for a function is
zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed
closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic)
should be avoided where possible. More than three
(polyadic) requires very special justification—and
then shouldn’t be used anyway._ **- Clean Code, Robert Cecil Martin**
